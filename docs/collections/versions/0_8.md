Collection miners now output a dict instead of a list, leading to better consistency in how data is accessed in the templates. BlogMapper has been replaced by two more general mappers, DefaultIndexMapper and DefaultTaxonomyMapper, so that is easier to create and group custom collections. DefaultSiteRenderer now accepts a new parameter, markdown, which is used to render html in the templates. This lead to better flexibility as users can supply their own custom markdown function. The default markdown function has also been improved. The logic behind filesystem monitoring has been rewritten, leading to faster site update when live editing.
