title: 0.7
---
The 0.7 is the biggest so far. Fist of all, there is a major change in how pages are displayed during development: instead of building the site on every text change, Kart builds pages dinamically, making developing templates on big sites a lot easier. As a matter of fact I tried modifying the templates on a 7500 posts site! Other code changes include splitting the modifiers into content_modifiers, the old ones, and map_modifiers, which are applied after map generation. The code has been refactored: now at the beginning of each file there is a parent class which helps understand which methods are needed to implement your own custom classes. Part of the code not tied to a specific class has now been move to the new utils.py file.
