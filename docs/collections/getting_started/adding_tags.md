# Adding tags

## Why do we use tags?
Sometimes you want to group your posts in a way that posts talking about the same subject can be found togheter. So we use tags.

## How do we use them with Kart.
Grouping posts is a very difficult job for static site generators, especially when you want to paginate them. Kart does all of this automatically. Morehover the templates generated by the quickstart command automatically adapt to tags. So the only thing we have to do is create some tags and tell the posts which tag do they have.

So first of all we have to crate a tag. Go to the collections/tags folder and create a markdown file. This name the filename is very important, but we will return to this in a moment.

```yaml
---
name: First Tag
---
```
The only metadata required is the name of the tag. It can be different from the name of the files. We could also write the description of the tag under the front matter. This data could be used by custom templates, for example in the page where all the posts tagged in the same way are listed. This fact is not irrelevant. Achieving this with other static site generators is not always straightforward.

Create some tags before moving to the next section.

## Tag a post
Now that we have created a tag we need to assign it to some posts. Go to the posts folder and open a file.
```yaml
---
title: My first post
date: YYYY/MM/DD
description: This is my first post
draft: False
---
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
```
Now we can add some tags with the following syntax
```yaml
---
title: My first post
date: YYYY/MM/DD
description: This is my first post
draft: False
tags:
  - first_tag
  - second_tag
---
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
```
It is very important that the name of the tag in the tags list is NOT the name of the tag, but instead its filename. This way we can have tag names with spaces, while having filenames with spaces is not recommended.

Look at the site in your browser. For each tag there is a page that will list every posts with the tag.
