# Adding Pages

## What are pages ?
In Kart, a page is a kind of content which desn't belong to a group(or it doesn't fit in a collection). An example of a page in a normal site is the contct or about page.

## Writing pages

To process to write pages is very similar to the one about posts. You have to create a markdown file in the pages folder

```yaml
---
title: About
---
This is the about page
```
The only data which is required in the front matter is the title

Because of the  templates created automatically in the navbar there will be a link for every page you write
