The 0.6 release introduces Modifiers, a new type of kart class. Modifier process and modify the site data, so it is available from every part of the site. It is very useful when trying to generate complex query in the templates, because it easier to do in python than in Jinja2 templates. Achieving the same with custom Mappers was and is still possible, but modifiers are now the recommended way because they are easier to use and if you want to implement a custom feature you no longer have to copy and paste the code from the default mappers.
